<h2 align="center">Hi, there ðŸ‘‹</h2>

<div align="center">
<p >My name is Jacobo, and I'm a Colombian Software Engineer. I was in Germany for the last 4 years, and a couple of months ago I moved back (temporarily) to my homecountry, Colombia.</p>

<p >I'm focused on <b>
 JavaScript
</b>
 (actually <b>
 <b>
 TypeScript
</b>
</b>). Both Backend and Frontend, I love sitting in front of my keyboard and just let my mind fly.</p>

<p>
I'm interested mostly on <b>industry-related</b>
 topics (deep down I still remain an Electronic Enginer). If you have a cool project in mind, or are looking for contributors for your project, and you think I might be a good match, just drop me a message.</p>
